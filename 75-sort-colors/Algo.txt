Since we have just three distinct values(0,1,2) so we will use 3 pointers for each digit 0 , 1 , 2 

i = 0                 ---------> for 0
j = 0                 ---------> for 1
k = len(array) -1     ---------> for 2

we will loop through the array until j is less or equal to k , once j crosses k we'll break the loop and we have done sorting the array

inside loop we'll check weather array[j] is equal to 0 or 1 or 2

if array[j] == 2:
we know this current element should be at kth index
so we will simply swap the element with kth index element and decrement k 

if array[j] == 1:
we know this current element should be at ith index
so we will simply swap the element with ith index element and increment both i and j bcz we initialized both i and j with same spot

if array[j] == 0:
we know this current element is its correct place
so we will simply just increment j to check the next element
