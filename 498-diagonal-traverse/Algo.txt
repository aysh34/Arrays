This is pretty much similar to sort the elements diagonally problem 

just remember two things when there is diagonal traversal of 2d matrix 

when you are traversing diagonal this way ↗ or ↙ use i+j , why???? bcz all elements in a specfic diagonal have same value for i+j
when you are traversing diagonal this way ↘ or ↖ use i-j , why???? bcz all elements in a specfic diagonal have same value for i-j

In this problem i am using i+j for traversing and storing all the diagonals in a map
    key(i+j) : value(list of elements having same value for i+j)


Now extract all the values from map and store them in a new list since we have to iterate over it.

whyy?????
bcz In problem its specified first go ↗ this way then go ↙ way

so i have to reverse every second(i.e even) value/list from new list while traversing
