If there are three sides lets say a, b, c then we can create a triangle with these if these three conditions fulfill:
a+b > c
a+c > b
b+c > a

but here is the catch , if these three sides are sorted in ascending order then we just need to check the one condition which is this
a+b > c


same applies in the problem , we first sort the array
since we need largest perimeter, so iterate backwards till 3rd last element bcz in each iteration we are checking for three numbers (ith no , i-1th no, i-2th no) so just stop at index 
2

if previous two numbers sum > current number, then we have found largest perimeter and we'll return the sum of these numbers

otherwise return 0 outside loop
