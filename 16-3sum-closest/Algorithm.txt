Since we have to return the sum so we can sort the array.
First sort the array.
Take a variable let's say closest and initialize it with the larget possible value +infinity.

Now iterate over the array till third last element (i = 0 to len(array)-2) 
  for each element array[i], use two pointer approach 
  left will be at index i+1, right will be at the last element
  now calculate the current sum of array[i] + array[left] + array[right]
  compare the absolute difference of (target - current sum) and absolute difference of (target - closest) to know weather the current sum is more close to the target or not (i.e 
  smaller than (target - closest))
  if it is, then simply update the closest to current sum

  also check which pointer either left or right to update based on weather current sum is larger or smaller then the target
  
return the closest
