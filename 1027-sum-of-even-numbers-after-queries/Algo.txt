nums = [1,2,3,4]              
queries = [[1,0], [2,3], [-4,0], [2,2]]

Each query has [value , index]

All you need to do is, go to the element at index(mention in query) in nums and add the value (mention in query)
When you've done this, now calculate the sum of even numbers in updated nums array
store it in an array bcz this is what you actually need to return

Brute force -------------> apply each query on nums array and iterate and calculate the sum of even numbers after each query. This costs O(N * n )
N = length of queries array
n = length of nums



Better approach --------------------> O(n) where n = length of queries array



Calculate the sum of even no in nums initially

Now iternate on queries:
first check the no in nums on which query must be applied is even or not
if its even, then this no must be contributed when we were calculating the sum of even numbers so subtract this no from the sum

now apply the query on this no which is basically adding value in this number

when we done adding, it means nums array has got updated

so we again check weather this new no is even or not
if it is, we have to calculate the sum again by adding this no in the sum

after this we are done with one query so we can add this sum to the resultant array
