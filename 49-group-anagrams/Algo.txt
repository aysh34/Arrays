Two strings are said to be anagrams if they have same elements with same frequency 

like ate, eat, tea

take a map
key (sorted version of the string) : value (list of original strings)

like this
aet : [ate, eat, tea]
ant : [nat , tan, ant]

loop through the given list of strings:
first sort each string
now look into the map if this sorted string as key exists in map already or not :
if it's not, make the new key with this sorted version and initialize an empty list as value
    simply append the unsorted original string in the list 


if key exists, simply append the unsorted original string in the value / list
